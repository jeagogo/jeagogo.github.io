			<p id="slogan">The Pacifica Spindrift Players, lovingly called PSP, is a non-profit organization committed to providing quality live community theatre to Pacifica and the Bay Area.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>The Mission of the Pacifica Spindrift Players (PSP) is to present high quality theatre to Pacifica and its surrounding communities. We offer revivals of traditional plays and musicals, as well as contemporary theatre for the 21st century. PSP also provides opportunities for adults and young people to learn the art of live theatre by creating a living classroom through the play production experience.</p>

			<p><strong>Pacifica Spindrift Players Values:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Non-Profit</strong>: PSP is a not for profit organization, and we are volunteer driven. Dedicated volunteers work in all areas of the theater, from front of house to performers to our Board of Directors. Please contact us if you’re interested in volunteering!</li>
				<li><strong>Fostering Community</strong>: We love to give back to our community! PSP reaches out to our community by participating in Fog Fest, loaning and donating equipment to high school productions, and offering special benefits and talent showcases for deserving causes.</li>
				<li><strong>Education</strong>: PSP believes that anyone interested can learn the art of theatre. We encourage new people to join us and learn – both onstage and behind-the-scenes.</li>

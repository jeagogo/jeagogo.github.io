	<h1>Spindrift Players</h1>
	<p>This is the theatre of Jennifer.</p>
	<p>Curl into a furry donut lay on arms while you're using the keyboard for damn that dog and purrr purr littel cat, little cat purr purr so annoy kitten brother with poking for crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened for stand in front of the computer screen. Eat the fat cats food climb leg, lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep so throw down all the stuff in the kitchen. 
	Attack the child mrow. Give me attention or face the wrath of my claws curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels but lick the curtain just to be annoying. Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff cats secretly make all the worlds muffins stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside meow meow swat at dog. 
	Slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep, scratch me there, elevator butt or ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box but meowwww, go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. Leave fur on owners clothes love but a nice warm laptop for me to sit on scratch at the door then walk away the dog smells bad but disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet.</p>
